Initializing agent...

## Error Message
```
Error: systemPrompt.map is not a function. (In 'systemPrompt.map((prompt) => ({ type: "text", text: prompt }))', 'systemPrompt.map' is undefined)
```

## Cause
This error occurs when the systemPrompt parameter is passed as a string instead of an array. The code expects systemPrompt to be an array that it can map over to create message objects.

## Solution
Ensure systemPrompt is always passed as an array, even if it contains only one prompt. For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect:
const systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant";

// Correct:
const systemPrompt = ["You are a helpful assistant"];
```

The fix was implemented by ensuring all calls to the API properly format systemPrompt as an array.
